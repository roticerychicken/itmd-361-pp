ITMD 361, Production Problem 8: jQuery and the Global Namespace

Open the site.js file in this directory, and rewrite its use of jQuery so that jQuery no longer controls the $ variable in the global namespace (window.$) while allowing the script as written to continue to use $. Hint: you might want to load up the index.html file in your browser with http-server so you can use Firefox Developer Edition’s JavaScript console to assist your revisions.
